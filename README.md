<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The objective of this website is to develop a general purpose online store so that people can buy and sell different types of product. In this project, anyone can buy and sell different types of products.</p>

<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>=> Visitor</p>
<p>=> User</p>

<h6>Visitor</h6>
<p>Visitor can view and search availale products</p>
<h6>User</h6>
<p>User can view, search, Add to Cart and purchase and also upload his/her product and alsp can edit and delete any product.</p>

<h1>How it works?</h1>
<p>As i wrote anyone can see available search available products but you have to be a user if you want to add a product to the cart. An alert will be shown when a visitor clicks on add to cart button which says "Please Login First". And when user clicks on the Add to cart button it will be added to the cart wheich he/she can see his/her cart by clicking on the cart icon which shows on the right side of the navbar. whenever a user click on the image or title of any any product the products detail will be shown and where a user can edit any product and also add to cart etc. </p>
<p>Visitor can not add a product to the cart so cart is useful for users only. In the cart user can set how many products user want user can not order more then the available stock. Products list will be shown in the cart where uer can delete any product if he/she dont want any product.</p>
<p>User can also see User profile where all the details of the user are showing.</p>
